## ü§ñ Recommendation Logic

The recommendation system uses a content-based filtering approach:

- Text Representation : Each product is represented as a string combining its category, tags, and name.

- Vectorization : These product texts are converted into vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency).

- Similarity Scoring: For the provided list of viewed product IDs, an average TF-IDF vector is computed.
- Cosine similarity is used to measure similarity between this average vector and all other products.

- Ranking: Products not in the viewed list are sorted by similarity score. The top 3 most similar products are returned.

- Fallback :If no viewed products are provided, 3 random products are returned.


## ‚úÖ Assumptions

- Each product has meaningful values for category, tags, or name.

- Up to 3 recommendations are returned per request.

- The system does not use collaborative filtering or user-specific preferences beyond the viewed product IDs.

- Product data is already present in the database and accessible via Django ORM.




## üì© Example Recommendation Request

### Request
```http
POST /recommendations/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "viewed_product_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Since you viewed Electronics, Books you might like these",
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Wireless Mouse",
      "category": "Electronics",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
